A joke python app for "hacking" your calculator
My first python thingy
## NOTE:THIS IS A JOKE AND NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY
## Step 1:How to set it up
Download the file,connect your calculator with a special circuit board cable
## Step 2:Running the app
## NOTE:YOU NEED PYTHON FOR THIS
Just open the .py file with your calculator plugged in
